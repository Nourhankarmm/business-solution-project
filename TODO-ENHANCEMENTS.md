# Influencer & Usher Platform - Enhancement TODO

## ðŸŽ¯ Priority: Critical (Phase 1)

### AI Model Enhancements

- [ ] Implement proper OpenAI API error handling and fallback strategies
- [ ] Add response caching to reduce API costs and improve performance
- [ ] Enhance prompt engineering with industry context and benchmarks
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and usage tracking for AI features
- [ ] Add user personalization based on user history and preferences

### Frontend Improvements

- [x] (ProfileForm, AiChatbot, RecommendationEngine, SubscriptionTiers, PaymentForm completed)
- [ ] Loading states and skeleton screens for better UX
- [ ] Real-time data updates with proper caching (SWR/React Query)
- [ ] Advanced form validation with Zod schemas
- [ ] Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## ðŸš€ High Priority (Phase 2)

### Backend Integration

- [ ] Database setup (PostgreSQL schema)
- [ ] Real API endpoints implementation
- [ ] JWT authentication with session management
- [ ] File storage integration (AWS S3)

### Third-party Integrations

- [ ] Real social media API integration (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube)
- [ ] Email service integration (SendGrid/Mailgun)
- [ ] Analytics service integration
- [ ] Stripe webhook handling

## ðŸ“Š Medium Priority (Phase 3)

### Advanced Features

- [ ] Real-time notifications (WebSocket implementation)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite (unit and integration tests)
- [ ] API documentation and user guides
- [ ] Performance monitoring and error tracking

### UI/UX Refinements

- [ ] Dark mode support
- [ ] Custom theme system
- [ ] Advanced filtering and search
- [ ] Data visualization charts
